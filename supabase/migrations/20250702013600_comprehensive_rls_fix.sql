/*
  # Comprehensive RLS Policy Fix for Infinite Recursion

  This migration provides a complete fix for all RLS policies causing infinite recursion.
  It runs after all existing migrations to ensure no policies are overridden.

  Issues being fixed:
  - "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'channel_members'"
  - Channel visibility and membership management
  - Message access control

  Strategy: Use direct enterprise membership checks instead of recursive channel_members queries
